# Angular Express Blog with MySQL

Based on the [Angular Express Seed](https://github.com/btford/angular-express-seed), this simple app illustrates how to use [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) and [Express](http://expressjs.com/) on a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) server to make a simple blog.

Test of the Angular Express Blog by Brian Ford (https://github.com/btford/angular-express-blog) but connecting to local MySQL database.


Work in Progress.
